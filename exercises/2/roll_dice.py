write a simulation of rolling dice                                                             *
where you should generate a random number between 1 and 6 inclusive                            *
before each rolling, you should ask if the user wants to continue the game                     *
                                                                                               *
P.S                                                                                            *
    we don't test this exercise result, so you can use all prints and user inputs as you want  *
    random.randint(start, stop) will return a number between start and stop                    *
                                                                                               *
