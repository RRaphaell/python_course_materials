Make a game named "guess number"                                                                *
where the computer chooses a number between 0 and 10, and the user has to guess it              *
The user has two trials. If the user correctly guesses the number on one of them,               *
you should print "you won" and print "you lose" otherwise                                       *
                                                                                                *
Because it's a bit hard to guess the number in 2 trials,                                        *
here is how you can help him:                                                                   *
if he enters a number that is lower than computer choice, print "your choice is lower"          *
otherwise print "your choice is higher"                                                         *
                                                                                                *
P.S                                                                                             *
    we don't test this exercise result, so you can use all prints and user inputs as you want   *
    random.randint(start, stop) will return a number between start and stop                     *
                                                                                                *
