You are driving a little too fast, and a police officer stops you.                      *
Write code to compute the result,                                                       *
If speed is 60 or less, the result is 0.                                                *
If speed is between 60 and 80 inclusive, the result is 100.                             *
If speed is between 80 and 100 inclusive, the result is 200.                            *
If speed is more than 100 you are arrested )).                                          *
Unless it is your birthday -- on that day, your speed can be 5 higher in all cases.     *
